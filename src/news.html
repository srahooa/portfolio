                <h3>The Start of Bootcamp</h3>
                <p class="date">Aug 26, 2019 7:47 PM</p>
                    <p>Can I code yet? Minimally. Will I be able to code in six months? Absolutely. </p>
                    <p>After getting our computers properly set up and key programs installed, we turned our attention to the terminal. As it was pointed out in class, mastering the command line will eventually save us heaps of time. While I am not nearly a master, I am substantially more comfortable using my terminal than ever before. </p>
                    <p>Once we all knew how to navigate our machines via command line, we turned our brains to Ruby. Things started off simple enough with operating in irb, learning integer, floats, booleans, and strings. We started learning the reserve words. At the end of the first week I felt comfortable with the materials. As we step into week two, I am not so sure. Stay tuned.</p>

                <h3>Terminal: week three and an application</h3>
                <p class="date">Sep 6, 2019 4:16 PM</p>
                    <p>I started to write a post one week ago, but then our first assessment was due and I dropped off the edge of the internet. I was going to start by saying “Week two is done and dusted and we’re onto the third. It’s amazing to think that in just two weeks we have covered the basics of Ruby and are now ready to start building an application to run in terminal.” However, now I have built that app and it has been submitted. Was it a good app? Nope. But I sure learned a hell of a lot along the way. It helped to cement some of the lessons of the previous two weeks, but I still need to continue to work in Ruby. Hello CodeWars!</p>
                    <p>I built a simplified version of the Oregon Trail computer game from 1971. I can see how the basic functions work, but am not yet able to logic my way through it all. I have learned significant lessons over the past week. The most apparent pertain to my learning style, my work flow habits, and confidence levels. It became quite apparent that I do not like asking for help. It was hard for me to consider asking for assistance when I was stuck on a problem. For as long as I can recall, I have relied on my stubbornness to find my own answers. In my present course of study, this will only slow me down. For study, I will need to repeat, repeat, and repeat again the days lessons at home. And I need to work on deep focus sessions as opposed to juggling all the tasks at once.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>When I had my check in meeting with one of our administrators, she reiterated that it is engraved in most women to second guess themselves. This is true with me. And it’s something that over the next six months I hope to shed. Coder Academy is not just teaching me code, its teaching me a whole lot else. Onwards and upwards!</p>
